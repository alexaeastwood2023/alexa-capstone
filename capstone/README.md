## How to use as a Typical User
 *Landing Page* (Once you open up the landing page in the browswer of your choice, you will see a navbar with my logo in the left hand corner, next to that will be Home, Contact, and Candles and then on the far right side is a button that says Sign In! 
 If you wish to sign up, you can click the button in the right hand corner and click on it. Once its clicked, a bootstrap5 modal will pop up with a title saying `Sign Up With Us!` underneath that is inputs to put your firstname, lastname, and email address and underneath that is a button thats clickable that says `Get Discounts!` (it is required so you HAVE to fill out the information in order to get discounts) once you fill out the required information you will click the button underneath it and then another modal will replace that other modal with a title that says `Enjoy Shopping With Us!` underneath that it says `Thank you (firstname and last name)for signing up with us! Please use your email address: (the email you put in) so you can get the discounts that we are giving!!!`
 Underneath the navbar theres my title of `Welcome to Get Some Scents` and underneath that is a bootstrap5 carousel with a few images of the candles that I am selling. 
 Then underneath that carousel is my blurb. It says `If your looking for scents, you found the right spot! Get Some Scents is a place where you can find any scent you want`.
 Underneath that is my footer with my contact information such as, email, physical address, and phone number all in which is clickable but does not go anyhwere because they are made up.) 

 *Contact Page* (Once your on the contact page, you will see a navbar with my logo in the left hand corner, next to that will be Home, Contact, and Candles. You will see a title that says `Contact Get Some Scents` 
 Underneath the title you will see that it says: Please click to like or follow us: underneath that it will have the fontawesome links for facebook, twitter, instagram, and linkedin with are indeed clickable. If you wish to click on them, I have made fakeHTML pages that states on ALL of them: a little picture of their logos and says  `I'm sorry this page can not load. Check your internet connection` with a loading spinner border that says Loading.... with a link underneath that says `Go Back To Get Some Scents` that will take you right back to the contact page of my website. 
 Then under that is Email Us: and provides the email address www.getsomescents.com, which is clickable but doesn't go anyhwere because it is not a real email address. 
 Under the email address is `Please Call Us At` and +574-225-5525 which is clickable but on my computer it pops up to facetime, so I do not know what it will do if anyone else clicks on it. 
 Underneath the phone number is `Or Visit Us At: 717 Starlight St. San Francisco, CA 94104` which is not an actual address. 
 Then there is the footer that has all my contact information such as, email, physical address, and phone number.)

 *Candle Page* (Once your on the Candles page, you will see navbar with my logo in the left hand corner, next to that will be Home, Contact, and Candles, and Shopping Cart. 
 Underneath that you will see a title of `Candles` underneath the title, is 27 cards with images of different cards with candles, as well as different titles, and different prices. All has a Qty: input so you can insert the right amount of candles you wish to purchase. Once you have done that on all the cards is also a button that says `Add To Cart`. 
 Once you found the right candle you want, you wil insert how many you would like, then hit the add to cart button, a rightside offcanvas will slide out and it will have my logo with a X that can be clicked on to close out of the offcanvas. 
 You will also see that it says `* Shopping Cart *` and underneath that is a table that has Qty, Scent, and Price so once you had added whatever it is that you want, it will show up over there. 
 *Then there will also be a remove button so that you can remove an item if you do not want it after all. If you chose to remove all items it will state `Your Cart Is Empty` 
 Underneath the table it has instructions on how to add more items into your add it says this: `If you want to update the qty on any item, please go back and put the qty and then click add to cart. Example: If you want 3 instead of 4, you just insert 3 again and then press add to cart` and underneath that you will see that it has added up your subtotal, your taxtotal, and then your grandtotal showing how much it will be with tax included. 
 *Once you have completed shopping and wish to proceed to check out there will be a button underneath the table that you can click on and a bootstap5 modal will pop up with a logo on the top of it and then a creditcard form that is indeed set to required so you will have to fill out the information to proceed. 
 Once you have filled out the information you will see that at the end of it it will show how much your card will be billed with a button that says Submit, once you click on the submit button another modal will show up that says `Your Order Has Been Submitted (the cardname you provided) We will email you the receipt to (email you provided) and there will be (a random % ranging from 10, 30, or 50 by using math.random in my js) discount on your next purchase! Thank you for shopping with us! Your card was charged (the total of your purchase) with an random image (that filters through 1-5 images by using math.random in my js) and then underneath that is says:  * Here is a gift for shopping with us!!!*` with a close button underneath that!)

 *** I ended up changing some things. I changed that on the shopping cart once you have added an item you can add or subtract items as well as added shipping and handling $6.25. I also changed the postion when it was in mobile view that way the images were centered. So everything that I got docked for I changed and things that I would have done different i changed as well!

    *Alysha Eppard helped me fixed my shopping cart and put localstorage in it. When you would refresh the page all the items in the cart would disappear. She also explained that I needed to do an onsubmit on my form instead of an onclick.
    
    *Chelsey Spaulding helped me with my actual shopping cart. She also told me that I didn't need an about page because you can clearly see what it is that I sell. She also helped me when it came down to adding up the items as well as tax and grandtotal. I have never seen a shopping cart so I wasn't sure on how to do it. She walked me through it and helped me understand it better. I used to hate cards but Chelsey gave me the idea to use them because I can not figure out what looks best, so I tried it and they looked great!
    
    * Rebecca Smith designed my logo for me.
